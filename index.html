                Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! Allons-y! Don't you think she looks tired? There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.

You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.
